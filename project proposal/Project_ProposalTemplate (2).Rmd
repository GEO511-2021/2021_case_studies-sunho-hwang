# Introduction to problem/question
  Due to global warming, one of the difficulties that the urban environment face is the increase of precipitation. There is a chance that this will lead to water pollution as the stormwater that runs through the urban impervious surface collects pollutants and enters the sewer system. There has been continuous effort to implement green infrastructure to adapt to this environmental change. However there are certain limits because this involves the voluntary participation of individual households. This study will help understand the demographic information of the participants of the past rain barrel project and help guide environmental organizations to plan who to target next for green infrastructure projects.
# Problem / Question
This project will analyze the motivation of households participating in the rain barrel project comparing contributing factors such as the education attainment and median income.
# Inspiring Examples


## Example 1
< Median Income Distribution Map >
Link: http://www.energyjustice.net/justice/index.php?gsLayer=income

![Example1](http://www.energyjustice.net/justice/index.php?gsLayer=income)




This map shows the median income level across Buffalo city. This project will also create a map to analyze the median income in order to  help understand the income level of people participating in the rain barrel project. (overlap rain barrel shapefile on top if possible)

## Example 2
<Education Attainment Distribution Map>
Link: http://www.edgetech-us.com/Map/EduLvls.htm

![Example2](http://www.edgetech-us.com/Map/EduLvls.htm)





This map explains the percentage of people who have received a certain education level. This project will also involve a map like this that shows the percentage of high school graduates to understand the education level of people who have participated in the rain barrel project.  (overlap rain barrel shapefile on top if possible)


## Example 3
<Pie chart of education level and median income>

![Example3](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2010/07/pie-charts-in-ggplot2/)





Instead of the female and male, this project will make a pie chart of the median income and education level. This pie chart will explain “what group with a certain level of median income installed rain barrels most in their individual households?” and “What group with certain level of education installed rain barrels most in their individual households?”

# Proposed data sources

1.	Rain Barrel Data : received from Buffalo Sewer Authority, shapefile of rain barrel installed in  2015 and 2016
2.	Median Income :  Census Bureau
Income in the past 12 months (2015,2016,block group level)-5 year subject table-Table: S1901
3.Education level : Census Bureau
Educational attainment for the population 25 years and over(2015,2016,block group level)-5 year estimate detailed table-Table: B15003


# Proposed methods

Packages : choroplethr, ggplot2
1.	Join table of income/education with rain barrel shapefile data: use the get_acs_data to receive table data from us census bureau, how should I join table of income/education with rain barrels is a problem.
2.	Put into a map for each topic: use tract_choropleth, but if it is possible to create a map at a smaller unit such as block group level try that.
3.	Make a pie chart using ggplot2.


# Expected results
The expected result is to produce a choropleth map of each topic and understand which areas the rain barrels are installed most. This will be represented into a pie chart for the better visualization. This will be a useful resource to figure out who to target for the next environmental planning project.
